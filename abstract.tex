Mankoff and Caspi, in \textbf{partnership} with the Taskar Center for Accessible Technology  (which Caspi runs) \jm{XXAnat: other partners??} will, in the course of this three year project, create a navigation solution for Deaf-blind individuals to easily create custom tangible maps that meet their diverse needs. 
 The project will pair a participatory, data-driven design approach together with interdisciplinary collaboration, to develop 3D printed, parametrically designed maps that allow for user feedback, and provide Deaf-blind populations unprecedented access to ever-changing digital map data. Thus, the \textbf{goal} of this project is to improve access for Deaf-blind individuals to the most current, up-to-date digital mapping and transit information available
and give them the independent ability to create their own maps.  The \textbf{objectives} are: 1) to extend the AccessMap interface to support need and route specification; 2) to automatically optimize map design based on specific needs; 3) to connect map production to existing online printing services. Anticipated \textbf{outcomes} include: 1) Deaf-blind individuals and those who support them will have the ability to independently create custom maps; 2) Custom maps will improve the navigation experience of Deaf-blind individuals; 3) Cost and time needed will not exceed existing services; 4) The solution will be integrated into the existing AccessMap infrastructure. The expected products are an algorithm for creating custom maps, an accessible interface for specifying customization parameters, and software integration with AccessMap.
