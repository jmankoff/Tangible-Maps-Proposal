Mankoff and Caspi, in \textbf{partnership} with the Taskar Center for Assistive Technology \todo{or AccessMaps?} (which Caspi runs)\todo{XX other partners}, and key stakeholders will, in the course of this three year project, create a navigation solution for Deaf-Blind individuals to easily create custom tangible maps that meet their diverse needs. \todo{Should we also mention soundscape?}.
The \textbf{goal} of this project is to improve the navigation services available to Deaf-Blind individuals and give them the independent ability to create their own maps.  The \textbf{objectives} are: 1) to extend the AccessMaps interface to support need and route specification; 2) to automatically optimize map design based on specific needs; 3) to connect map production to existing online printing services. Anticipated \textbf{outcomes} include: 1) Deaf-Blind individuals and those who support them will have the ability to independently create custom maps; 2) Custom maps will improve the navigation experience of Deaf-Blind individuals; 3) Cost and time needed will not exceed existing services; 4) The solution will be integrated into the existing AccessMaps infrastructure. The expected products are an algorithm for creating custom maps, an accessible interface for specifying customization parameters, and software integration with AccessMaps.
