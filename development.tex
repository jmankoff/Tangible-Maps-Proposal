\jm{Notes from conversation with Harniss:
Emphasize iteration
Blow smoke about the algorithms

\subsection{Input from Stakeholders}
Describe how input will be collected from key stakeholders (including people with disabilities) to guide development activities.

\subsection{Stage of Development and Specific Plan}

This project includes both the \textit{proof of concept} stage and the \textit{proof of product} stage:
\begin{description}
\item[Implementing and Testing Optimization Algorithm (Proof of Concept)] While we have preliminary results demonstrating the viability of optimization for this problems space \ref{sec:optimization}, our proposed work includes recruiting and testing with Deaf-blind individuals \ref{sec:lab-tests}, and resolving remaining challenges in optimization \ref{sec:optimization}.
\item[Testing in Natural Contexts (Proof of product)] Our proposed work also includes field studies. We will be testing the map in use in field settings \ref{sec:field-map}, and testing the entire system (including web-based map creation) in the field \ref{sec:field-web}. 
\item[Fully Integrated Prototype (Proof of product)]
Our final implementation will be integrated into AccessMaps, a publicly available mapping application. \ref{sec:accessmaps-integration}.
\item[Verification of Technical Requirements (Proof of product)]
We will validate the generalizability of our approach \jm{keep this? What is the appropriate technical validation?} \ref{sec:technical-validation}
\end{description}
