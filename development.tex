Our development activities will focus on iterative refinement of the
two main threads of the work, namely the development of high quality
optimal tangible maps, and the development of a web interface that
empowers Deaf-blind individuals to requisition their own maps on the
fly.

With respect to maps (Product 1), we next discuss the long history of tangible map use
for accessibility, and the importance of bringing down the price and
increasing the customizability of maps (Section~\ref{sec:background}. We then discuss our
optimization approach in Section~\ref{sec:optimize}, and the iterative
design approach we plan to take to improve our technology in
Section~\ref{sec:mapping-validation}.

With respect to the web interface (Product 2), we highlight the lack
of end-user control in our review of related work
(Section~\ref{sec:background}). In
Section~\ref{sec:accessmap-extension} we discuss the AccessMap
interface and our plans to extend it. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:stakeholder-input}, we discuss how input
from key stakeholders (namely our intended users) will be collected to
ensure that the interface proposed in
Section~\ref{sec:accessmap-extension} is correctly meeting their
needs.

We conclude with a discussion of the stage of development
(Section~\ref{sec:stage}). We argue that the work represents a
combination of proof of concept and proof of product.
