We will take a user-centered, iterative approach to the design of our mapping solution. All of our studies will be conducted with the population we are serving, Deaf-blind users. PI Caspi has extensive experience working with this population \jm{true?} and will be able to help ensure that we have access to participants. 

\subsubsection{Map Study 1: Map Understanding With and Without Optimization}
\label{sec:lab-tests}
Our first study will focus on demonstrating the benefits of optimization in a controlled fashion. For this study, we will use pre-defined maps focusing on neighborhoods familiar to participants. we will ask participants to indicate the location of a well known landmark, and to describe the region around the landmark. We will also ask participants to describe features of a route between two landmarks. We will then have them do the same tasks with an optimized map. \jm{how do we ensure famimliarity? do we care about route finding? How do we make sure the optimization is relevant to them? How do we train them on all the renditions' meanings?+}

\subsubsection{Technical Validation}

\subsubsection{Map Study 2: Navigation Benefits of Optimization}
\label{sec:field-map}
\jm{I think we also want a study of them choosing a route of their choice and using our system?}
