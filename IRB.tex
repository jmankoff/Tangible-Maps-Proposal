%If you marked "Yes" for Item 3 on the Supplemental Information for SF 424, you must provide a human subjects "exempt research" or "nonexempt research" narrative. Insert the narrative(s) in the space provided. If you have multiple projects and need to provide more than one narrative, please indicate which project each set of responses addresses.

%\begin{itemize}
 %   \item Exempt Research Narrative. If you marked "Yes" for item 3a. and designated exemption number(s), provide the "exempt research" narrative. The narrative must contain sufficient information about the involvement of human subjects in the proposed research to allow a determination that the designated exemption(s) are appropriate. The narrative must be succinct. In addition, narratives are required for each participating partner if research is being conducted at other sites.
%    \item Nonexempt Research Narrative. If you marked "No" for item 3a., you must provide the "nonexempt research" narrative. The narrative must address the seven points. Although no specific page limitation applies to this section of the application, be succinct.
%\end{itemize}

%Human Subject Requirements for HHS grants. If your proposed project(s) involves research on human subjects, you must comply with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)
%Regulations (Title 45 Code of Federal Regulations Part 46) regarding the protection of human research subjects, unless that research is exempt as specified in the regulation. All awardees and their performance sites engaged in research involving human subjects must have or obtain:
%(1) an assurance of compliance with the Regulations, and (2) initial and continuing approval of the research by an appropriately constituted and registered institutional review board. In
%order to obtain a Federal wide Assurance (FWA) of Protection for Human Subjects, the applicant may complete an on-line application at the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) website or write to the OHRP for an application. To obtain a FWA, contact OHRP at: http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp.

%For all proposed clinical trials, NIDILRR is requiring that applicants address the safety of human subjects participating in such trials or studies. This discussion must be identified in the application as a data and safety monitoring plan (Plan) and specifically address the safety of the participants and the validity and integrity of the data produced by the study. The Plan will be reviewed by NIDILRR staff prior to the award of the grant. Furthermore, a data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) is required for all multi-site clinical trials involving interventions that entail potential risk to participants. The data and safety monitoring plan must include a discussion of the DSMB if warranted by the proposed research activity. The Plan does not count against the page limitations described in this FOA and is not subject to the evaluation and scoring by the peer review panel.

%\subsection{Exempt Research Narrative}

%A. Exempt Research Narrative.
%If you marked “Yes” for item 3.b. and designated exemption numbers(s), attach the “exempt research” narrative to the Supplemental Information for the SF-424. The narrative must contain sufficient information about the involvement of human subjects in the proposed research to allow a determination by NIDILRR that the designated exemption(s) are appropriate. The narrative must be succinct.
%\subsection{ Nonexempt Research Narrative.}
%If you marked “No” for item 3.b. you must attach the “nonexempt research” narrative to the
%Supplemental Information for the SF-424. The narrative must address the following seven points. Although no specific page limitation applies to this section of the application, be succinct.
%\begin{description}

This proposal involves iterative design, including a number of studies that involve human subjects (specifically, Map Study 1 and 3; AccessMaps Study 1 and 2). 

\subsection{Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics}

%Provide a detailed description of the proposed involvement of human subjects. Describe the characteristics of the subject population, including their anticipated number, age range, and health status. Identify the criteria for inclusion or exclusion of any subpopulation. Explain the rationale for the involvement of special classes of subjects, such as children, children with disabilities, adults with disabilities, persons with mental disabilities, pregnant women, prisoners, institutionalized individuals, or others who are likely to be vulnerable
Participants will include adults who are Blind (Map Study 1) and Deaf-blind (all other studies). Participants will be asked to take part in interviews, walkthroughs, and focus groups, paired with surveys, and questionnaires. In addition, participants will be asked to complete navigation tasks in field settings. 

\subsection{Sources of Materials}
%Identify the sources of research material obtained from individually identifiable living human subjects in the form of specimens, records, or data. Indicate whether the material or data will be obtained specifically for research purposes or whether use will be made of existing specimens, records, or data.

Materials will be collected during study sessions. These will include logs of behavior when using the online system, and recordings of interviews and study sessions. 

\subsection{Recruitment and Informed Consent}
%Describe plans for the recruitment of subjects and the consent procedures to be followed. Include the circumstances under which consent will be sought and obtained, who will seek it, the nature of the information to be provided to prospective subjects, and the method of documenting consent. State if the Institutional Review Board (IRB) has authorized a modification or waiver of the elements of consent or the requirement for documentation of consent.
Adults with visual or hearing impairments will be recruited.
We will recruit participants through community agencies in the Seattle Area such as the Lighthouse for the Blind and the Deaf Blind Service Center (DBSC). We’ll also partner with needs experts by asking them to share a description of our study by word of mouth and email. We will use snowball sampling to expand this pool. Informed consent will be a prerequisite to participation in all studies. 

\subsection{ Potential Risks}
%Describe potential risks (physical, psychological, social, legal, or other) and assess their likelihood and seriousness. Where appropriate, describe alternative treatments and procedures that might be advantageous to the subjects.

There are no direct benefits for participating in the study. Potential risks to participants include feeling uncomfortable discussing the character of their visual or hearing impairment and uncertainty about how to answer questions and finding the time it would take to participate in the study. However, the researchers will provide description of the study and explain that the participation is voluntary, participants can choose not to answer any or all questions, and can leave the study at any time. 

Although we will maintain confidentiality regarding participation and the qualitative data records will be de-identified, the participants will be unable to remain anonymous due to the nature of the interview, walkthrough and focus group methodologies.

Another risk is the inherent risk in navigating a city, on sidewalks shared by other pedestrians alongside roads with cars on them. Although this is a risk, it is no higher than the risk already faced by participants in their own everyday navigation activities. 

%(5) Protection Against Risk: Describe the procedures for protecting against or minimizing potential risks, including risks to confidentiality, and assess their likely effectiveness. Where
%appropriate, discuss provisions for ensuring necessary medical or professional intervention in the event of adverse effects to the subjects. Also, where appropriate, describe the provisions for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of the subjects.

\subsection{Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained}
%Discuss the importance of the knowledge gained or to be gained as a result of the proposed research. Discuss why the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits to subjects and in relation to the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result.

%\item[Collaborating Site(s)]: If research involving human subjects will take place at collaborating site(s) or other performance site(s), name the sites and briefly describe their involvement or role in the research.

%\end{description}

The knowledge gained through participation in our studies will help to improve the quality of our product, and ultimately to improve the navigation experience and opportunities available to Deaf-blind people.
